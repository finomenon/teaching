<!-- Okay, but how do I start a site from scratch? -->
<!-- Good question, lets start take a step back and start from the beginning -->

<!-- DOCTYPE. What is Doctype? Essentially, it tells the browser what version of HTML you are using. You almost always want to use the latest version, but in some rare cases, you may need to support very old browsers, or depricated HTML tags. For more information about Doctype, read here:
http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_DOCTYPE.asp -->

<!-- STEP 1: Add <!DOCTYPE html> to the top of this page -->

<!-- The <html> tag. All your of your other HTML elements need to be wrapped in the <html> tag. This is HTML convention, and should always be followed -->

<!-- STEP 2: Create and open and closed <html> tag -->

<!-- The <head> tag. One way to think of this tag, is it's where all of your page configuration. In the <head> tag, you can specify a title for your page (which will show up in tabs), load external files, make your site more searchable with meta tags, and much more. For more information about the <head> tag, read here:
http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_head.asp -->

<!-- STEP 3: Inside the <html> tag, create an open and close <head> tag -->

<!-- The <body> tag. The <body> tag is where all of your page content will go. Pretty much everything that makes up the page that the user will see, goes here. For more information about the <body> tag, read this article: 
http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_body.asp -->

<!-- STEP 3: Inside the <html> tag, and underneath the <head> tag, create an open and close <body> tag -->

<!-- *** NOTE: What you've created in Steps 1-3 is the absolute minimum for ever HTML site you will ever create. You should always start with these 3 steps. -->


<!-- A little more about the HEAD -->
<!-- Lets set a title for the header, and add a browser icon.  -->

<!-- STEP 4: Inside the <head> tag, create an open and close <title> tag. Add "Lawyer Dog, Woof!" inbetween the open and closing <title> tags -->

<!-- STEP 5: Inside the <head> tag, and underneath <title> tag, create an open and close <link> tag. Add "Lawyer Dog, Woof!" inbetween the open and closing <title> tags. 
			 Set the <title> attributes as follows:
			 rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico" -->

<!-- STEP 6: Reload the browser, and notice the text and icon in the browser tab -->
