		<!--Let's create a Header. 
			So ... HOW DO I CHOOSE MY TAGS?
			1) Here is a list of all possible tags. Read, and know them:  the http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp
			2) Your tags should be semeantic. They should describe what goes where, specifically how your content is structured. This is called, The Semantic Web. Many tags were deprecated with HTML 4 and 5, because they did not meet this critera (eg: blink, strong, etc, describe the way a site looks, which is really the job of CSS). You should avoid depricated tags. 
			3) Is it supported by the necessary browsers: http://caniuse.com/

		<!-- Step 1: Crate a <nav> element nested inside the <div id="header"> tag. The nav tag is designed to hold all global navigation links. -->
		<!-- Step 2: Add six links inside the <nav> tag, using the <a> tag. -->
		<!-- Step 3: Add an href="" attribute to each <a> tag. Set the values as follows:
			        	1) href="index.html"  NOTE: This is called a "relative URL". Linking to files, or other pages within your site should use relative URLS
			         	2) href="pages/bark.html"
			         	3) href="pages/chase.html"
			         	4) href="pages/pant.html"
			         	5) href="pages/wag.html"
			         	6) href="pages/habeascorpus.html" 
		-->
        <!-- Step 4: Add text as content to each link as well. This will become the user-facing label of the link:
			        	1) ***don't add any content here yet
			         	2) Bark
			         	3) Chase
			         	4) Pant
			         	5) Wag
			         	6) Habeas Corpus
		-->
		<!-- Step 5: Lets add a logo to the first link using the <img> tag. Set the the src attribute to "images/logo.png" -->
		<!-- Step 6: Create another <div> underneath the <nav> element, and set the id attribut to "social" -->
		<!-- Step 7: Create two links inside this new <div>, and set the href attributes as follows:
						1) https://twitter.com/dogethedog   NOTE: This is called an "absolute URL". Links that point to pages or sites outside of your site, should use the complet address starting with http
						2) https://www.facebook.com/DogeTheDog
		-->
		<!-- Step 8: Add an icon for each link using the <img> tag, similar to how we created the logo. Set the src attributes as follows:
						1) images/twitter.png
						2) images/facebook.png
